# Accessibility proof of concept - testing Android input fields

Debugging behavior in React Native led me to check how is "native native" doing.

As a web dev that is a bit of a barrier, so hope somebody with strong Android skills can make a more React Native-near code instead.

It did make it possible to test it with TalkBack, so I hope this will still be useful.
